# Introduction to the project
This repository contains all the files needed for:
- Pose estimation of a robot using DWM1001 Ultra-WideBand Localization devices
- Application of an Extended Kalman Filter to improve the pose estimation accuracy
- Comparison with ground truth values taken from the Optitrack localization system
The whole system has been tried and works on Ubuntu 20.04 with the Noetic Ninjemys version of ROS. The robot model used for this project is a unicycle, the simulation in the real environment is done with Turtlebot 2. 

# Setup of the work environment
To properly setup your work environment to be able to use the localization system, you need to setup a catkin worksapce, then you need to clone this repository into the "src" folder.
Here's a brief explanation of the packages:
1) *ekf_unicycle_package* : package that contains the code to apply the Extended Kalman Filter to generate an estimation of the robot's pose, using the datas from the robot's odometry and the position generated by the UWB devices.
   
2) *ros-dwm1001-uwb-localization-master* : package that contains all the files related to the UltraWideBand localization system. The position of the tag/tags is obtained by combining the information of fixed anchors. The maximum number of anchors used for a single tag for the position estimation is 4 (the system chooses the 4 anchors closest to the tag's position). A serial connection from the tag to the computer is needed. At least 3 anchors are needed to estimate the in a proper way, better if it's 4 or more.
 The two main files to run are:
- dwm1001_active_1tag: this is the code to estimate the position of a robot. A single tag is needed; its 2D or 3D position is calculated by combining the information received by the fixed anchors. 
- dwm1001_active_2tag: this is the code to estimate the pose of a robot. 2 tags are needed. The robot's 2D or 3D position is obtained by combining the two tags' positions. The orientation is obtained by using the atan2 with respect to the estimated x and y positions of the tags.

3) *vrpn_client_ros* : package that contains the files to initialize the Optitrack localization system on ROS. For this matter, the optitrack is used as the ground truth information for the calculation of the error between the UWB estimated trajectory, the trajectory after the EKF filtering action and the real trajectory (knowing that the Optitrack has a very high accuracy).
