# Introduction to the project
This repository contains all the files needed for:
- Pose estimation of a robot using DWM1001 Ultra-WideBand Localization devices
- Application of an Extended Kalman Filter to improve the pose estimation accuracy
- Comparison with ground truth values taken from the Optitrack localization system
The robot model used for this project is a unicycle, the simulation in the real environment is done with Turtlebot 2. 

# Setup of the work environment
The following steps describe how to properly setup your work environment to be able to use the localization system:
1) Clone the GitHub link in the src of your catkin workspace
